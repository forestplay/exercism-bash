Concise way to manage the optional input: ${var:-default} form of parameter expansion here in the manual.


For arithmetic operations (numbers), prefer (( over [[. (( is an arithmetic operation while [[ is used for strings.
Also, avoid let command for initializing number variables.  Using (( )) instead.


Remember to always quote your variable expansions!
